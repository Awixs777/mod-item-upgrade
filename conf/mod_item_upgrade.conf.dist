# Item upgrade module configuration
########################################
#
#    ItemUpgrade.Enable
#        Description: Enable the module or not. If the module is toggled off, items that were previously upgraded will lose their upgrade bonus.
#                     Re-enabling the module will restore the already upgraded item bonuses.
#        Default:     0 - Disabled
#                     1 - Enabled
#

ItemUpgrade.Enable = 1

#
#    ItemUpgrade.AllowedStats
#        Description: Stats that are allowed to be upgraded. These correspond to the ItemModType enum from ItemTemplate.h
#                     For example, to allow "Attack power" to be upgraded, there is ITEM_MOD_ATTACK_POWER = 38 in the enum,
#                     so just add it to the list of allowed stats. Values are separated by ,
#                     Items that were upgraded with a certain stat will LOSE their upgrade bonus if you remove the stat from
#                     allowed list. If you re-add the stat, the items will GAIN back their upgrade bonus for that stat.
#        Default:     3,4,5,6,7,32,36,45
#

ItemUpgrade.AllowedStats = 3,4,5,6,7,32,36,45

#
#    ItemUpgrade.SendUpgradedItemsPackets
#        Description: Whether to send SMSG_ITEM_QUERY_SINGLE_RESPONSE for upgraded items. This will ensure that owner will see the stats correctly
#                     when reading item description. ONLY the owner will see the stats though and this DOES NOT work for items that have random
#                     properties (stats that are random after acquiring the item, such as "of the Bear" or "of Intellect" items). The limitation
#                     is due to WOTLK client nature and is not possible to be solved. Weapon upgrades (min/max damage increased) WILL also be
#                     visible for items with random properties.
#                     THIS ONLY AFFECTS VISUALS, UPGRADED STATS WILL BE THERE NONETHELESS!
#        Default:     0 - Disabled
#                     1 - Enabled
#

ItemUpgrade.SendUpgradedItemsPackets = 1

#
#    ItemUpgrade.SendUpgradedItemsPacketsPrioritization
#        Description: Since SMSG_ITEM_QUERY_SINGLE_RESPONSE is sent by item ENTRY and not by universal identifier (GUID) it means that if
#                     multiple items with the same entry have upgrades (whether stat upgrades or weapon upgrades) then the player will see
#                     the exact same stats and damage for ALL items with the same entry. So there must be some kind of prioritization,
#                     whether to choose the item with the most stat upgrades or with the highest weapon upgrade percentage.
#                     Example: if player has two Ramaladni's Blade of Culling and both items were upgraded, one with 5% weapon damage upgrade
#                              and the other with 10% weapon damage upgrade AND ItemUpgrade.SendUpgradedItemsPacketsPrioritization is 1
#                              then the player will see both weapons have 10% more damage. Again this is only VISUAL, stats are correctly
#                              calculated for both!
#        Values  :    0 - Prioritize upgraded stats (items with higher number of upgraded stats will be prioritized)
#                     1 - Prioritize weapon upgrade (items with the highest weapon upgrade percentage will be prioritized)
#        Default :    0
